1-Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.
2-Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.
3-Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
4-Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17
5-Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum 
	and computing the product of 1,…,n.
6-Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.
7-Write a program that prints all prime numbers. (Note: if your programming language does not support arbitrary size numbers,
	printing all primes up to the largest number you can easily represent is fine too.)
8-Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether 
	their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed.
	I counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.
